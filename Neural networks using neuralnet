# Load that data set on Portuguese wines
wine <- read.csv2("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, dec = ".")
# Note: maybe because the Portuguese use commas for decimals, I had to set full stops as decimals to avoid loading numerics as chars

# I didn't iterate too much, I stopped at the following model:
wine_model <- quality ~ volatile.acidity + chlorides + pH + sulphates + alcohol
wine_reg <- lm(wine_model, data=wine)
summary(wine_reg)

# install.packages("neuralnet", dependencies = TRUE)
library(neuralnet)
wine_nn <- neuralnet(wine_model, data=wine, hidden=c(3, 2), linear.output = FALSE)      
plot(wine_nn)

# Making predictions
newwine <- list(volatile.acidity=0.660, chlorides=0.073, pH=3.40, sulphates=0.75, alcohol=10.2)
pred <- predict.nn(wine_nn, newwine)
